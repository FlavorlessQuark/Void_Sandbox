# Void_Sandbox
Playing around with voids, pointers, and void *

## Taking time to experiment

Most of the code here has no real purpose apart from me trying to figure out how C works.

Non working code will most likely be comented instead of deleted so that I can look back at it later and understand better why things work the way they do and not the way they don't;

I would like to have a better understand of macros and pointers in general as they are , I think, my weakest point in C
