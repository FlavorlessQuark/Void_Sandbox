# Void_Sandbox
Playing around with voids, pointers, and void *

## Taking time to experiment

Most of the code here has no real purpose apart from me trying to figure out how C works.

Non working code will most likely be comented instead of deleted so that I can look back at it later and understand better why things work the way they do and not the way they don't;

I would like to have a better understand of macros and pointers in general as they are , I think, my weakest point in C

Testing type compatibility with buitilin compatible and trying to use struct as an array of multiple types to avoid nested Generic calls...
Looks like that's going to be difficult, but to avoid nested generic, I can probably have one Generic and then a bunch of if else in a function.

The problem stems from me trying to versimpify something that is complex by nature, I think.
Still I will keep thinking for different ways to do this.

Casting things to other things in a sort of abstract way, hopefully this paves the way for something useful
